  The ".block" Class
  this the start of a "block" component, is a div with the "block" class
  applied to it.  you can find the .block class defined in the styles.css file.

  this document is primarily a vertical list of "blocks", each with a "description"
  and "examples" div inside it.  the "flex" and "grid-whatever" attributes
  control the layout of these components and the ones inside them.  We'll look
  at exactly how they work later.

  this nested structure of
    <html>
      <head>
        {blah blah blah stuff here}
      </head>
      <body>
        {blah blah blah stuff here}
      </body>
    </html>
is part of how html documents operate.  you can add in other stuff, but this is
more or less fixed (unless you're doing something weird).

the nested structure of
  <"block">
    <"description">
      {blah blah blah stuff here}
    </"description">
    <"examples">
      {blah blah blah stuff here}
    </"examples">
  </"block">
is how i decided to organize the code for this document.  creating rules and
structures like this make it easier to read, write, and modify the code.

The ".examples" Class
here is an "examples" div.  it has two classes, "examples" and "auto-margins".
the "auto-margins" class adds top and bottom margins to vertically center the
stuff inside the "examples" div.  i didn't want it applied to every single "example"
div, so put it in a separate class.

        respects.  html documents don't care about normal whitespace characters,

        a css class.

this next block is about using elements as css selectors.  i used an <h6> element
as the example because there are no <h6>'s in use in this html document.  i mean,

  <div class="block">
    <div class="description">
      <p>
        When you use an <span class="selector-type">HTML element</span> as the selector, all elements of that type will be styled.<br />
        for example,
      </p>
      <p class="css-text">
        h6 {<br />
        &emsp;background: hotpink;<br />
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        will give all the <span class="html-text">&lt;h6&gt;</span>s a hot pink background.
      </p>
      <p>
        An <span class="html-text">&lt;h6&gt;</span> is the smallest kind of header (there are 6 sizes of header, h1 - h6). You don't have
        to do anything to the HTML elements to get the styling applied to them, all
        <span class="html-text">&lt;h6&gt;</span> elements will get the styling (in this case, a pink background).
      </p>
      <!--
      this paragraph contains an <a> element.  these are pretty much always links
      to other web pages.  however, we should avoid calling them links, because
      there is a <link /> element (there is one in the <head>, linking the css file
      to this html file).

        You can see an unhelpfully comprehensive list of html elements <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">here</a>.

i'm going to leave this next "block" uncommented.  Sometimes an abundance of
comments makes it harder to see the structure of the code.

  <div class="block">

      <p>
        The next selector is by <span class="selector-type">class</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="css-text">
        .class-example {<br />
        &emsp;background: orange;<br />
        &emsp;font-family: "comic sans";<br />
        &emsp;color: purple;<br />
        &emsp;height: 100px;<br />
        &emsp;width: 300px<br />
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        The elements that use this styling need to have the class added.
      </p>
      <p class="html-text">
        &lt;div class="class-example"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
        Because classes have a period before their name, you could have:
      </p>
      <p class="css-text">
        p {<br />
        &emsp;color:blue;<br />
        } <br />
        .p {<br />
        &emsp;color: orange;<br />
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        <span class="html-text">&lt;p&gt;</span> elements would have a blue background, and anything given the
        class "p" would have an orange background. This would be really confusing,
        and probably a bad idea.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="examples">
      <button class="class-example">button</button>
      <div class="class-example">
        div
      </div>
      <input class="class-example" value="text input" />
      <p>
        *note that these three different elements (button, div, input) all look very similar,
        because they have the same CSS class
      </p>
    </div>

that's the end of that "block"!
the "description" side has classes applied to paragraphs and spans to style the
html and css snippets.
the "examples" has the same class applied to a variety of different elements.

  <div class="block">
    <div class="description">
      <p>
        The third kind of selector is by <span class="selector-type">id</span>.
      </p>
      <p class="css-text">
        #id-example {<br />
        &emsp;height: 100px;<br />
        &emsp;width: 200px;<br />
        &emsp;background: purple;<br />

      <p class="html-text">
        &lt;div id="id-example"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
      </p>
      <p>
        An id used basically the same way as a class, except a hash is used instead
        of a period in the CSS file, and <span class="selector-type">id</span> is
        used instead of <span class="selector-type">class</span> in the HTML element.
      </p>
      <p>
        An id should only be applied to a single HTML element. <br />
        Firstly, it's confusing to have multiple elements with the same id, and other
        developers won't understand what your intent was.<br />
        Secondly, we'll use id's later to find and change HTML elements. Having duplicate
        id's can create undesirable results.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="examples auto-margins">

  <div class="block">
    <div class="description">
      <p>
        Selectors override each other by specificity. An <span class="selector-type">id</span> will override
        a <span class="selector-type">class</span>, which will override <span class="selector-type">element</span> styling.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="examples">
      <h6>here is an h6 with no class or id</h6>
      <h6 class="class-example">this h6 uses the class-example class</h6>
      <h6 class="class-example" id="h6-id-example">this h6 has a class and and id</h6>
    </div>
  </div>
  <div class="block">
    <div class="description">
      <p>
        Selectors also override each other if they are further down the CSS document. For example,
        if both of these classes are applied to an element, it's color will be green instead of purple,
        because <span class="css-text">second-class-example</span> is further down the CSS sheet.

      <p class="css-text">
        .class-example{<br />

        &emsp;color: purple;<br />
        &emsp;height: 100px;<br />
        &emsp;width: 300px;<br />
        }<br /><br />
        .second-class-example {<br />
        &emsp;color: green;<br />
        }

    <div class="examples">
      <div class="class-example second-class-example">
        this div has the classes class-example and second-class-example
      </div>
      <div class="second-class-example class-example">
        this div has the two classes, in the opposite order. The class second in the CSS file still takes precedence.
