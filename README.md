## A couple of HTML / CSS exercises

This contains two sets of HTML/CSS files.  The first is index.html and styles.css, which talk about css styling and provides examples.  The other set, edit_this_html.html and edit_this_css.css have some small problems for you to solve.

There are 11 tasks in all, and they are listed throughout the edit_this_html.html file.
