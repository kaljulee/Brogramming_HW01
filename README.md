## A couple of HTML / CSS exercises

This contains two sets of HTML/CSS files.  The first is index.html and styles.css, which talk about css styling and provides examples.  The other set, edit_this_html.html and edit_this_css.css have some small problems for you to solve.

There are 11 tasks in all, and they are listed throughout the edit_this_html.html file.

To get the files, open the powershell in your projects folder and use the github cli.  The command can be found in the green code button in this github repo.
