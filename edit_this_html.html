   PART 1:
   using the "first-set" class, add a blue background color to the first
  -->
  <h4>first set</h4>
  <div class="set-container">
    <div class="base-set">

    <div class="base-set">
    </div>
    <div class="base-set">
    </div>
    <!--
   PART 2:
   add another div with the "first-set" class under this comment.
   it should appear in line with the other three
  -->
  </div>

  <!--
  PART 3:
  add classes to the three divs in the set-container.  all three should get
  the "base-set" class, the last one should also get the "second-set" class,
  making it purple.
 -->
  <h4>second set</h4>
  <div class="set-container">

    <div>
    </div>

    <div>
    </div>

    <div>
    </div>

  </div>

  <!--
  PART 4:
  go to the css file and create styling for the h4 element
  it should include the following attributes:
  background: lightblue;
  padding: 5px;
 -->

<!--
PART 5: add the "grid-container" class to the "set-container" div below.

PART 6: change the "yes", "no", and "maybe" from divs to buttons.  remember to
change both the opening and closing tags.

PART 7: give the buttons the class "response-button".

PART 8: give the "will you let the dog bite you" an id of "question", so that it
uses the "question" styling from the css file.

PART 9: give the yes, no, and maybe buttons the id's of
"yes-button" (this is the only one that will do something at this point)
"no-button"
"maybe-button"

PART 10: the no-button and maybe-button styles don't exist yet, add them to the
css file.  these styles should be id's, so the name has a # prefix, not a .

PART 11: give the button styles the following colors:
yes-button - color: green;
no-button - color: red;
maybe-button - color: orange;

  <h4>third set</h4>

    <div>yes</div>
    <div>no</div>
